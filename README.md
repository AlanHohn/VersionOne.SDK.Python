* Dynamic reflection of all V1 asset types

    Just instantiate a V1Meta.  All asset types defined on the server are available
    as attributes on the instance.  The metadata is only loaded once, so you must
    create a new instance of V1Meta to pick up metadata changes.

* Simple access to individual assets.

    Assets are created on demand and cached so that once instance always represents
    the same asset.  
  
* Lazyily loaded values and relations

    Asset instances are created with any data available, and query the server on-demand
    for attributes that aren't currently fetched. 

* Simple query syntax::

      for s in v1.Story.where(Name='Add feature X to main product"):
          print s.Name, s.CreateDate, [o.name for o in s.Owners]
      
* Simple creation syntax::

      new_story = v1.Story.create(Name='New Story', scope=v1.Scope(1002))
  
* Simple update syntax::

      v1.Story(1005).Name = 'Super Cool Feature Redux'
      v1.Owners = list( v1.Members.where(Name='Joe Koberg') )
      v1.commit()
